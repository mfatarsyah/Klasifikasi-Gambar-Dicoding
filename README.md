# Car-Bike Image Classification



## 📌 Description  
This project focuses on **image classification** using deep learning to distinguish between **cars and bikes**. The model is trained on the `car-bike` dataset, which contains images of both vehicle types. The goal is to build a robust classifier that can accurately identify whether an image belongs to the **car** or **bike** category.

## 🚀 Features  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** using TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Trained on the `car-bike` dataset**  
- **Achieves at least 85% accuracy**  
- **Exports the model in multiple formats** (`SavedModel`, `TF-Lite`, `TFJS`)  
- **Uses Google Colab for training and evaluation**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of two categories:  
- **Car** 🚗: Images of cars  
- **Bike** 🏍️: Images of bikes
